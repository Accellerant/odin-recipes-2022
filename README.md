== Description ==

Note: The original project was completed back in December, but 
        Odin Project was updated, so I'm going through all the
        content once more as recommended by their news update to do.

The purpose of this project is to display the following skills
I've learned thus far:

    * Utilization of Basic HTML
        * Boilerplate
        * Basic elements 

    * Use of basic GIT commands
        * Adding, Committing, and Pushing

    * Proper use of the Linux CLI
        * Creating and managing files
